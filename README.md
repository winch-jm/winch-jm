Hi, I'm Jeff!

I currently work at the New York Stem Cell Foundation where I develop automated tools to leverage ML/computer vision for quality checking in high-throughput imaging assays. I also investigate phenotypes of aging and neurodegenerative diseases from large-scale, multi-modal data collected from stem cell disease models. 

My current research interests include multi-modal data integration, representation learning, and interpretable AI. Feel free to:
