Hi, I'm Jeff!
I'm currently a master's student at Carnegie Mellon studying computational biology. I previously worked at the New York Stem Cell Foundation where I developed automated tools to leverage ML/computer vision for quality checking in high-throughput imaging assays. I also investigated phenotypes of aging and neurodegenerative diseases from large-scale, multi-modal data collected from stem cell disease models. 

My current research interests include multi-modal data integration, representation learning, and interpretable AI. Feel free to:
